An analysis of airline flight delays and how we can make better travel decisions before they cascade across the world.\n

This is a data science project that I worked on while attending Springboard’s Data Science curriculum. Here I leverage exploratory data analysis to find trends in a year’s worth of flight data to predict cascading delays in other locations. The results show that certain types of delays are easier to predict than others.
