  description: `<p>
  I am a jovial Software Developer that thrives on innovative and quality creations.
  <br>
  <br>
  My experience is in <nobr style="color:rgb(14 165 233)">Data Science</nobr> and <nobr style="color:rgb(217 70 239)">Full Stack</nobr> development. I hold an <nobr style="color:rgb(34 197 94)">Associates Degree</nobr> from the University of Hawaii
  with a certification in  data science from Springboard. My best work is building data-centric Python applications leverging the Django or Pandas frameworks, but
  I am also a well-rounded web developer using React.js.
  <br>
  <br>
  Because I am always looking to push the envelope and improve my skills, I am currently studying the C++ programming
  language. Also, you can find me moonlighting in indie game development to keep my skills sharp.
